 Which particles cause these signals and what are their characteristicsin terms of rate at sea level and energy?
    comsic radiation, mainly pions and myons


 What are the particles you expect to cause a signal and what are their characteristics?
    Gamma radiation? maybe electrons die internal convertiert werden
    bestimmte energien sollten triggern=>kaskaden sollten proportional zu der energie sein oder? also die intensit√§t ~ energie
 How do you expect the signal to look like compared to the one from cosmics? Does that correspond to your observations?
